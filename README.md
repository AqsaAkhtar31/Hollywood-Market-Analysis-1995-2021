# Hollywood-Market-Analysis-1995-2021

2020 and 2021 have been rough years for the movie industry, and being a huge movie fanatic inspired me to share a dataset showing the exponential growth of box office collections as well as ticket sales over time (and the decline after 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic) indirectly indicating the quality of modern day films. This Dataset can also be used to study the genres which attract audience the most and encourage one to create an amazing genre specific plot in order to take one step closer to becoming the next most successful director!
